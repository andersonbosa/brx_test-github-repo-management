### Improvement plan

Generated using AI, through the analysis of "whole" comments in the code is made a general survey of improvement ideas.

```markdown
#### Docker and Service Management

1. **`docker-compose.yml` (line 57):** The suggestion is to consolidate agents performing background activities, such as data processing, into a separate service from the API project. This will allow scalability and better resource utilization. A dedicated service can be created for this purpose and managed separately.

#### Backend

1. **`github-search.controller.ts` (lines 22, 58):** Implement pagination in searching GitHub users and listing user repositories. This is important for handling large data sets efficiently.

2. **`ExportButton.tsx` and `ImportButton.tsx`:** Implement background processing for data conversion (to CSV format) passing through the queue. This is essential for handling large amounts of data without blocking the user interface.

3. **`user-orders.controller.ts` and `maria-db-user-orders.repository.ts`:** Implement processing of imported data using background jobs and a queue, as suggested in the requirements. This will ensure that processing is done asynchronously and efficiently.

4. **`github.repository.ts` (line 20):** Investigate and implement improvements to optimize access and manipulation of GitHub repository data.

5. **`route.ts` (line 7):** Implement authentication for consuming the backend API. This will ensure that only authorized users can access the API resources.

#### Frontend

1. **`page.tsx`:** Investigate and fix the CSS rule affecting the layout of elements on the page. It may be related to margins or paddings causing layout issues.

2. **`RepoList.tsx` (lines 36, 66, 98):** Implement "load more" pagination functionality to handle large data sets efficiently. Additionally, add sorting and filtering options to improve the user experience.

3. **`ViewImportedData.tsx` (line 49):** Similarly to the repository list, implement pagination or "load more" feature to handle large data sets efficiently.

#### General

1. **`Makefile`:** Consider creating targets to automate common tasks such as environment setup, running tests, and running the project. This will simplify the development process and continuous integration.

2. **`index.tsx` (lines 14, 55):** Refactor and improve variable and function names to make the code more readable and understandable. Additionally, consider separating the context by features for better code organization and maintenance.

3. **`events.tsx`:** Centralize events in a constant and separate file to facilitate management and avoid code duplication.

4. **`env.config.ts` (line 15):** Improve obtaining the address and port of the Next.js itself for a more robust and scalable configuration.

#### Plans/Future Implementations

1. Implement a complete authentication system with sessions and authorization to ensure user and data security.

2. Refactor the code to ensure a more modular and scalable architecture, separating responsibilities and using appropriate design patterns.

3. Implement automated tests to ensure code quality and system stability.

4. Consider adopting more modern and efficient technologies, such as GraphQL for the API and Redux for state management in the frontend.

5. Explore the possibility of integrating with other platforms besides GitHub, increasing the flexibility and utility of the application.
